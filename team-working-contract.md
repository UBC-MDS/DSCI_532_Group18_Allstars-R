**Culture**
- Speak our minds openly, constructively and respectfully, and receive this feedback assuming the best of intentions
- Value the effort of others and celebrate small wins
- Dedicate a portion of our weekly meeting to relax and chat over a drink
- Help team members to improve their skills and knowledge
- Help each other out when we get stuck in project tasks

**Expectations**
- Rotate who takes notes for meetings, and post meeting minutes in the repo issues section
- Complete the draft milestone by 12am Friday
- State our goals and the path of our project so everyone is on equal footing
- Plan to have meetings on Thursday in the evening, expect to meet online twice a week
- Be on time for meetings
- Assigned tasks are completed prior to the start of a meeting
- During a meeting, we all focus on what is being discussed (rather than trying to multitask with our own personal tasks)
- team members are generally available most days

**Conflict**
- Endeavour to resolve conflicts through the group. The group should decide before personal issues are escalated to Joel
- Decisions are made by the majority
